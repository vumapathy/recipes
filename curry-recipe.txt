2 cups cauliflower florets

Add the coconut oil to a large sauce pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Heat until melted and hot, about 1 minute. Add the onion and cook, stirring constantly, until it starts to soften, 3-4 minutes. Add the curry paste and cook for about 1 minute or until fragrant, stirring constantly to make sure it doesn't burn. Add the coconut milk and the sugar, if using, and stir until smooth.
Add the kabocha squash and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the kabocha is tender, about 10 minutes. Add the cauliflower and tofu. Cover again and cook, stirring once or twice, until the cauliflower is fork tender, about 5 minutes. Gently stir in the kale, being careful not to break up the tofu. Simmer uncovered until kale has wilted, about 3 minutes, then season with salt to taste.
Serve over rice or quinoa and garnish with Thai basil leaves, if desired.
